# Web3Signer

:::caution YubiHSM 2 and USB Armory Mk II deprecation notice
Web3Signer has deprecated private key storage support on USB Armory Mk II and YubiHSM 2, and will remove it in a future release.

If you need this feature, consider maintaining a fork and submitting pull requests. Alternatively, you can
use an older Web3Signer version that supports these storage mechanisms.
:::

Web3Signer is an open-source remote signing service developed under the Apache 2.0 license and written in Java.
