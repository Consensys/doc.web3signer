# TLS communication

Web3Signer supports TLS to secure inbound and outbound HTTP JSON-RPC requests, and communication
with HashiCorp Vault.

Private keys and certificates for client and server TLS connections must be stored in
password-protected PKCS #12 keystores.
The server (in this example, [Besu](https://besu.hyperledger.org/)) must be configured
to accept TLS connections.

Use the command line options to configure TLS on [HTTP JSON-RPC requests](../how-to/configure-tls.md)
and [HashiCorp Vault](../how-to/store-keys/vaults/hashicorp.md).
